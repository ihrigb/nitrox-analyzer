# nitrox-analyzer

> **Warning** Diving is a sport that needs proper training. Especially diving with technical, pressurized gases and their correct handling requires additional training and the right equipment. I take no guarantee on the device, circtuis, plans and code. Your life depends on the correct measurement of your breathing gas.

This project is based on the nitrox analyzer published by *goobes* on Instructables (https://www.instructables.com/id/Home-Made-One-Hand-Nitrox-Analyser-Arduino-Based/)
